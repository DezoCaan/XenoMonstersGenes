  An unsuccessful attempt to create my own mod for RimWorld.

  

  This mod uses some assets from another mod called [Combat Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2890901044&searchtext=combat+extended).

  In turn, the Combat Extended mod is a continuation and expansion of its [original version for Rimworld 1.0](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=33461.0).

  Combat Extended is also used under [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

    

  Harmony by Brrainz.  
  Vanilla Expanded Framework by Oskar Potocki.  
  Rimworld is owned by Tynan Sylvester.
